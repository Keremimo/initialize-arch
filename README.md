# initialize-arch
Personal application that initiates a post-install Arch environment in my own way as a learning project. Still incomplete.

Written in Go for no other reason than learning some Go syntax while I build something useful for me.

You think I'd rather use bash scripts, well I already have bash scripts. I don't have an app written in Go.

When finished, it will be able to turn a minimal Arch install into a ready to rock development platform, just how I like it.

Will use bitwarden cli and a few other opinionated tools. When the code is at a usable state, a guide to use will be released alongside.
