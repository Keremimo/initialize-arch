# initialize-arch
Personal application that initiates a post-install Arch environment in a very opinionated way.

Written in Go for no other reason than learning Go.

When finished, it will be able to turn a minimal Arch install into a ready to rock development platform, just how I like it.

Will use bitwarden cli and a few other opinionated tools.
